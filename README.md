When I first heard that Dr. Martin Odersky is teaching Scala, I couldn't resist.

Although I found half way down the course - scala was interesting and easy to follow, but later parts
were a little hard and one has to think functional.  

I have a Math background, so I enjoyed this course.  However, all these years I have been programming in Java, C/C++
and therefor it might take some time for me to get the hang of Functional Programming.

Overall, I think Dr. Odersky is a very high class teacher and I hope I meet him some day.
